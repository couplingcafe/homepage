The native speaker can keep track of the learner&#8217;s progress, and jump in to respond to questions or provide more context on words and phrases.</p><p><strong>In the last two weeks</strong>, I have set up the server, database, login, and signup. For the app, I have built the flashcard system (modeled after Anki). You can create, view, review, add notes to, and request for help on flashcards. I&#8217;ve also built the friend request system to invite your partner. </p><a class=\"image-link image2 image2-857-1456\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef8fdc0c-044b-4c15-a9b0-d82d51a96e2c_1494x879.png\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef8fdc0c-044b-4c15-a9b0-d82d51a96e2c_1494x879.png\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ef8fdc0c-044b-4c15-a9b0-d82d51a96e2c_1494x879.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:857,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:168344,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}\" alt=\"\"><style>\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-857-1456 {\n            padding-bottom: 58.85989010989011%;\n            padding-bottom: min(58.85989010989011%, 857px);\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 0;\n          }\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-857-1456 img {\n            max-width: 1456px;\n            max-height: 857px;\n          }\n        </style></a><h2>What&#8217;s Next</h2><p>I&#8217;m improving the tools and interface for the native speaker to assist the learner. There are so many different levels of motivation and styles between learner and native speakers across different couples. That&#8217;s a main source of friction between two people learning languages from each other. Coupling will make it seamless for a native speaking partner to hop on whenever they are free, see the learner&#8217;s progress, and check off a few tasks to help them out. </p><p>I&#8217;m improving the flashcard creation flow. Building your own flashcard deck is a great way to learn. I want to make it super quick to add a flashcard with the app providing you automatic translations and big fat buttons to attach images and audio.</p><h2>Collecting Flashcards</h2><p>A vision I have is to make collecting new vocabulary and phrases like collecting trading cards. Language learning videos and podcasts can provide links to flashcard booster packs that you can click to add to your deck. A browser extension can let you right-click words to add to your deck. A messenger between you and your partner can generate flashcards from natural relevant conversations to add to your deck. Then language challenges can tailor to you based on the words that are found in your deck.</p><p>Stay safe, everyone!</p>"],"date":"October 26 2020","image":"/assets/img/logo.png"},{"title":"Introducing Coupling!","description":["Learn Your Loved One&#8217;s Language"],"link":["https://coupling.substack.com/p/introducing-coupling"],"guid":[{"_":"https://coupling.substack.com/p/introducing-coupling","$":{"isPermaLink":"true"}}],"dc:creator":["Coupling"],"pubDate":["Thu, 08 Oct 2020 11:04:14 GMT"],"enclosure":[{"$":{"url":"https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/75a7cae7-70ee-4013-9c3b-27fae76c64b9_292x292.jpeg","length":"0","type":"image/jpeg"}}],"content:encoded":["<p>Hello!

I&#8217;ve been self-studying Cantonese and Mandarin for many years, learning mostly on my own. I also know a bit of Spanish. Coming up on five languages now, I recently discovered I loved learning languages.</p><p>But <strong>learning a language these days is often a lonely activity</strong>: tap on gamified apps, listen to headless voices, read textbooks, talk to strangers online. All these activities are helpful, but language itself is meant to be social. I have a native speaker beside me, all day every day. I wondered why the learning was taking place inside my own head when languages involve ears and mouths.&nbsp;</p><p>While backpacking in off-trail wilderness for 70 miles, through wildfire smoke, Heidi was teaching me more Chinese, and it was fun! I thought about the non-effectiveness of how couples normally try to learn each other&#8217;s languages, and I came up with ideas to solve this and help couples grow closer together. And here we are!</p><h3>How Coupling Will Work</h3><p>Coupling makes it easy for your native speaking partner to be a language guide without having to be a language teacher.</p><p>First, you self-study with <a href=\"https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition\">spaced repetition flashcards</a>. It&#8217;s a learning technique where you are shown flashcards right as you are about to forget them. The more you learn a word, the less often you need to review that flashcard. This system is used by polyglots and medical students to reliably memorize thousands of terms.&nbsp;</p><p>Then Coupling reinforces your self-study by lightly looping in your partner. You will be able to:</p><ul><li><p>Flag your partner for help in Coupling on flashcards that give you trouble. Your partner, whenever they are free or bored, can open Coupling and add a comment to the flashcard to clarify and explain. Or they can add some quick audio and video to the flashcard.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://learncoupling.com/challenge\">Play daily challenges and games</a> to practice listening and speaking. Real life usage reinforces your vocabulary you self-learned. This can take as little as five to ten minutes per day. Short daily sessions create a healthy habit. Even if you just learn one word per day, that&#8217;s big!</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Watch silly mini-videos from your partner that teach bite-sized pieces of the language. Because the content is created by your loved one, it&#8217;s personalized and makes things that much more memorable. Call it TikTok for language learning, but just between you two.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Generate flashcards you learned from daily challenges and via a messenger built into the app. The messenger will show a translation to your target language underneath each message, which you can tap to add to your flashcard deck and lock it into your memory.</p></li></ul><a class=\"image-link image2 image2-481-524\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffdc2a9aa-0457-4af1-ab1a-c81a5bb93a88_720x660.png\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffdc2a9aa-0457-4af1-ab1a-c81a5bb93a88_720x660.png\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fdc2a9aa-0457-4af1-ab1a-c81a5bb93a88_720x660.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:660,&quot;width&quot;:720,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:524,&quot;bytes&quot;:55764,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}\" alt=\"\"><style>\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-481-524 {\n            padding-bottom: 91.66666666666666%;\n            padding-bottom: min(91.66666666666666%, 480.3333333333333px);\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 0;\n          }\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-481-524 img {\n            max-width: 524px;\n            max-height: 480.3333333333333px;\n          }\n        </style></a><h3>The Right Balance</h3><p>By achieving the right balance between self-study and help from your partner, we avoid the <strong>two common pitfalls</strong> I&#8217;ve seen in couples:</p><ul><li><p>Over-reliance on the native speaking partner&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Under-utilization of the native speaking partner</p></li></ul><p>If you solely rely on your partner to teach you the target language, they will burn out. On the other hand, if you learn completely in stealth, it&#8217;ll be hard for you to remember anything without using it daily, and you&#8217;ll probably suck at speaking and listening.</p><p><strong>Coupling is a holistic approach: a spaced repetition flashcard system to help you learn on your own, while making it easy on your native speaking partner to assist you.</strong> Coupling guides them on how to guide you, lets them help you asynchronously, and keeps the minimal time commitment low.</p><p>There&#8217;s a big benefit of having a language guide that is very close to you. Your native speaking partner is aware of what words you know, what words you don&#8217;t know, your exact level of the language. When my wife gives me example sentences, she tailors the complexity and speed to the right level for me. And with my wife being pretty fluent (but not mastered) in English, I know I need to throw SAT-level words and up-to-date idioms at her.<strong> So your language learning is ultra-personalized</strong>, whether you are a beginner, intermediate, advanced, or near-fluent.&nbsp;</p><h3>Next Steps</h3><a class=\"image-link image2 image2-512-278\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2de79b0d-0552-48c1-919e-ed9a8fb1dd91_278x512.png\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2de79b0d-0552-48c1-919e-ed9a8fb1dd91_278x512.png\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2de79b0d-0552-48c1-919e-ed9a8fb1dd91_278x512.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:512,&quot;width&quot;:278,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:21575,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}\" alt=\"\"><style>\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-512-278 {\n            padding-bottom: 184.17266187050362%;\n            padding-bottom: min(184.17266187050362%, 512px);\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 0;\n          }\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-512-278 img {\n            max-width: 278px;\n            max-height: 512px;\n          }\n        </style></a><p>I have a lot of ideas on how language learning can be improved both for couples and in general. I&#8217;m personally invested in it myself.

I&#8217;m not claiming to be a language expert by any means, but I think I could build something helpful!</p><p>Unless you are fortunate enough to be fully immersed, learning a language is a grind right now. <strong>I want to change that and make language learning a fun, personalized, social activity.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I have started posting <a href=\"https://learncoupling.com/challenge/\">daily challenges on the website</a> while I build the core features such as flashcards, translations, and audio samples. <a href=\"https://mailchimp.com\">Sign up to our newsletter</a> to get updates if you haven&#8217;t already.
