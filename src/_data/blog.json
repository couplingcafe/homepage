Fortunately, it only took me an hour or so to add full support for Cantonese! Including audio recordings, Jyutping, and sentence breakdowns. Cantonese was the first language I started trying to learn, for 8 years now, so this is exciting for me.</p><h3>&#127470;&#127479;&#127475;&#127477; Fallback Audio Recordings for Farsi and Nepalese</h3><p>I didn&#8217;t have audio recordings for Farsi and Nepalese, so for now, I have them falling back to use the audio generators for Arabic and Hindi, since they use similar writing systems. It sort of works! Until I add ability to add your own recordings.</p><h3>&#128172; Email Notifications (If Your Partner Did Stuff)</h3><p>Get notified of notable recent partner activity that you haven&#8217;t seen. This email will go out at most once per day, only if there was partner activity that you haven&#8217;t seen. Let me know if there is anything I can do to improve this, or other ways you would like to be notified.</p><p>You can customize your email notification settings in your user settings in Coupling.</p><h3>&#128256; Shuffled Queue</h3><p>The review queue is now shuffled by default, so you won&#8217;t be reviewing things in the same exact order every time now.</p><h2>What&#8217;s Next?</h2><p>More and more people have started to use Coupling and joined the Discord. I&#8217;ve been learning lots from people&#8217;s experiences and ideas on language learning. Here&#8217;s Coupling&#8217;s short-term feature roadmap (pushing out some of the roadmap features I had on the last update):</p><h3>&#127897;&#65039; Audio Recordings From You and Your Partner</h3><p>Finding good audio recordings from native speakers is one of the tougher things in creating good vocabulary flashcards. Since we are native speakers or having native speaking partners that are<em> </em>willing to help, we have a great resource for audio recordings.</p><p>I&#8217;ll be implementing <strong>ability to add your own audio recordings for you and your partner</strong>. What better voice to listen and learn from than the voice of your partner.</p><h3>&#128200; Graphs and Statistics</h3><p>It&#8217;s crucial to be able to <strong>visualize your progress</strong>. Language learning apps with streaks are commonplace after Duolingo &amp; Co. Someone noted they&#8217;ll study harder with streaks. So that&#8217;s on the roadmap.</p><p>Beyond streaks, I&#8217;ll <strong>add graphs</strong>, to show your vocabulary accumulated over time, rate of flashcards added, rate of reviews, future review schedule, and a graph for each individual vocabulary showing the rate of their mastery as you acquire, learn, review, and sometimes forget.</p><h3>&#128240; Ten Million Sentences</h3><p><strong>Sentence mining</strong> is common among language learners. I&#8217;ve mined millions of community-generated sentences. I haven&#8217;t gotten around to it yet since last week, but soon, matching sentences will be shown in the sentences section of your flashcards.</p><p>A fun idea is <strong>N+1 learning through sentences</strong>. To have Coupling analyze the vocabulary you know. Then suggest sentences for you to learn, where you know <strong>most</strong> of the words, but not all of them. This is the N+1 method, take what you know, and learn a little bit more on top of it.</p><h3>&#128231; Weekly Progress Emails</h3><p>An optional digest email sent to you and your partner summarizing language learning activity for the week: number of vocabulary learned, number of vocabulary added for each other, number of reviews, days of studying skipped, etc. I think most of us language learners wouldn&#8217;t mind a nudge sometimes!</p><p>Longer term roadmap includes having a shareable profile and being able to add multiple people (friends and family) to join along.</p><h2>&#128296; Tip: Adding New Vocabulary From Breakdowns</h2><p>In the breakdown section of flashcards (the one that takes each word in a phrase or each character in word, and shows you individual definitions), if you click the words, you&#8217;ll be led to the add form where you can add those words to your deck with a click.</p><p>Back to work!</p><p>~ kevin</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://learncoupling.com/discord&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Join the Discord&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:null}\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://learncoupling.com/discord\"><span>Join the Discord</span></a></p>"],"date":"March 11 2021","image":"/assets/img/logo.png","subtitle":"Coupling's roadmap.

But I still need to show English as an intermediary language on booster packs, and add <strong>a flag option</strong> to mark down bad translations.</p><h2>&#128232; Signup Improvements</h2><p>When signing up and inviting your partner, your partner will get an email notification to join. Now <strong>when your partner uses that invite link, they will automatically be paired with you after signing up</strong>.</p><p>You will also receive in-app notifications when you receive an invite or your invite has been accepted. There have also been a few bug fixes with the login and signup flow.</p><h2>&#128218; Imported Dictionaries</h2><p>We&#8217;re continuing to import dozens of dictionaries into our database, containing millions of entries. <strong>Coupling uses dictionaries to generate breakdowns of phrases</strong> to their individual words and their meanings.</p><h2>What&#8217;s Next?</h2><p>Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m working on next week!</p><h3>&#128240; Over Ten Million Sentences</h3><p>Currently in Coupling, you and your partner can add sentences for each vocabularly. I&#8217;ve <strong>imported over ten million sentences to display as built-in examples as you are learning new vocabulary</strong>. These sentences will become available in the app next week.</p><h3>&#128276; Notifications (Optional)</h3><p>It&#8217;s easy to forget about this language learning app you signed up for, and s<strong>ometimes you need a bit of a kick to get learning</strong>.</p><p>I&#8217;ll add optional email (and later opt-in SMS) notifications to get notified when your partner communicates with you in the app (asked or answered a question, added vocabulary for you, poked you to complete your daily studies). These can be instant, or a weekly digest. You can also opt-in to get notified when you are falling behind on your studies. </p><h3>&#127873; More Booster Packs</h3><p>I&#8217;ll continue to add booster pack categories containing hundreds of more vocabulary! Some relevant ones might be talking to your partner&#8217;s family, or perhaps we had a request for bedroom-related ones.</p><h3>&#128202; Vocabulary Frequencies</h3><p>I&#8217;d like to import data on pieces of vocabulary, how frequently they are used in real life. This would be helpful to learn how relatively important each piece of vocabulary is. I have some data from corpuses of movies and TV shows. For Chinese, specifically, I can display HSK levels as well!</p><h3>&#127918; More Interactive Language Games</h3><p>After I get all of those settled, I&#8217;ll work on building language games. For example, <em><strong>Guess Who?</strong></em> where you each choose one of a few dozen pictures of characters, and need to ask and answer each other&#8217;s questions in your target language to narrow down what character your partner chose. First one to guess the character wins!</p><h2>Join the Discord and Try Out!</h2><p>My goal is to create something that can actually be useful for you to learn a language and grow closer to your partner and have fun.

The app lets you know once the necessary vocabulary has been learned (via the review system), and the challenge is ready to play. </p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 image2-1906-596\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7dba079-0d4d-49b9-8a40-0c2619a99fba_2880x9206.png\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7dba079-0d4d-49b9-8a40-0c2619a99fba_2880x9206.png\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e7dba079-0d4d-49b9-8a40-0c2619a99fba_2880x9206.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:4654,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:596,&quot;bytes&quot;:5706157,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}\" alt=\"\"><style>\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-1906-596 {\n            padding-bottom: 319.64285714285717%;\n            padding-bottom: min(319.64285714285717%, 1905.0714285714287px);\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 0;\n          }\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-1906-596 img {\n            max-width: 596px;\n            max-height: 1905.0714285714287px;\n          }\n        </style></a></figure></div><p>The idea is to make sure you learn the vocabulary well before trying to practice it in real life. Otherwise it wouldn&#8217;t be fun (and perhaps irritating) for the native speaking partner to teach you vocabulary from scratch. The challenges provide a way to practice speaking and listening in real life with vocabulary you&#8217;ve already acquired via self-study.</p><p>An example challenge is <strong>Simon Says</strong>, where you learn, listen for, and execute physical commands such as stand up, sit down, go to the bathroom. The first level of the challenge is listening for these commands from your partner and rapidly executing them. Getting your body involved physically will drill the vocabulary further into your head. You learn not only the whole phrases, but key vocabulary such as adjectives, verbs, and nouns comprising the phrases.</p><p>Design of progression in language learning is popular. <strong>The levels progressively get harder,</strong> involving doing actions on objects (<em>pick up the cup)</em>, doing actions on objects <em>pick up the big cup)</em>, compound sentences (<em>pick up the big cup and give it to me), </em>and adverbs (<em>pick up the big cup quickly and give it to me slowly).</em></p><p>You get a badge for completing the challenge, unlocking further levels, and your partner gets a badge for bossing you around!</p><p>Other challenges might include discussing a funny picture or video, role-playing situations, playing hide-and-seek with objects, or a game of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guess_Who%3F\">Guess Who?</a></p><h3>Flashcard Editing</h3><p>Knocking out an expected feature, the ability to<strong> edit flashcards</strong> after adding them to your deck.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 image2-960-1456\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13113b31-cbfc-45b2-8d2c-6cc7006918ae_1978x1304.png\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13113b31-cbfc-45b2-8d2c-6cc7006918ae_1978x1304.png\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/13113b31-cbfc-45b2-8d2c-6cc7006918ae_1978x1304.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:960,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1151860,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}\" alt=\"\"><style>\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-960-1456 {\n            padding-bottom: 65.93406593406593%;\n            padding-bottom: min(65.93406593406593%, 960px);\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 0;\n          }\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-960-1456 img {\n            max-width: 1456px;\n            max-height: 960px;\n          }\n        </style></a></figure></div><h3>Flashcard Statistics</h3><p>I&#8217;ve added a section to view learning statistics for each individual piece of vocabulary.

Phrases are analyzed to extract words (e.g., groups of characters) which are then looked up and translated individually. That lets us break down phrases and sentences.</p><h2>An Adaptable Language Learning Couple Dynamic</h2><p>The foundation of Coupling is an <strong>easy system for you to pick up vocabulary and efficiently commit them to memory</strong> via spaced repetition. This itself gives you an app that looks like &#8220;Anki specifically for language learning&#8221; for self-study.</p><p>I&#8217;m treating picking up vocabulary like collecting Pokemon cards. You have a deck of vocabulary, which can be cards from starter decks, and you can add cards via booster packs that I continually release. <strong>You choose what cards you want to learn and are relevant to you</strong>.</p><p>Then you have <strong>challenge booster packs</strong> that contains vocabulary necessary to complete a real-life practice session with your partner. Before you can unlock the challenge, you need to learn all the vocabulary first. Coupling keeps track of your progress on learning each piece of vocabulary.</p><p><strong>How much your partner is involved is flexible and adaptable</strong> based on how patient they are. There&#8217;s a spectrum. They can check in on your progress and statistics just to encourage you and keep your accountable. They can jump in and help with vocabulary you are struggling to remember. They can add vocabulary for you. And they can engage in however many challenges they want to do with you per week.</p><p>My goal is to release within the next week for a few people to try, and then open it up an alpha for everyone to try.

What I don&#8217;t want to do is overload the native speaker. The learner should come prepared to practice sessions.</p><p>So I plan on <strong>locking language challenges behind a progression wall</strong>. Language challenges will come attached with flashcards that will be necessary to learn. After the learner absorbs each flashcard, the challenge becomes unlocked.</p><p>For example, let&#8217;s say we have a language challenge around giving directions while driving. The challenge in the app would come with a set of words or phrases to add to the flashcard deck. Those words could be &#8220;turn left&#8221;, &#8220;stop&#8221;, or &#8220;go&#8221;.

There are so many different levels of motivation and styles between learner and native speakers across different couples. That&#8217;s a main source of friction between two people learning languages from each other. Coupling will make it seamless for a native speaking partner to hop on whenever they are free, see the learner&#8217;s progress, and check off a few tasks to help them out. </p><p>I&#8217;m improving the flashcard creation flow. Building your own flashcard deck is a great way to learn. I want to make it super quick to add a flashcard with the app providing you automatic translations and big fat buttons to attach images and audio.</p><h2>Collecting Flashcards</h2><p>A vision I have is to make collecting new vocabulary and phrases like collecting trading cards. Language learning videos and podcasts can provide links to flashcard booster packs that you can click to add to your deck. A browser extension can let you right-click words to add to your deck. A messenger between you and your partner can generate flashcards from natural relevant conversations to add to your deck. Then language challenges can tailor to you based on the words that are found in your deck.</p><p>Stay safe, everyone!</p>"],"date":"October 26 2020","image":"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef8fdc0c-044b-4c15-a9b0-d82d51a96e2c_1494x879.png","subtitle":"Initial functionality is coming together!"},{"title":"Introducing Coupling!","description":["Learn Your Loved One&#8217;s Language"],"link":["https://coupling.substack.com/p/introducing-coupling"],"guid":[{"_":"https://coupling.substack.com/p/introducing-coupling","$":{"isPermaLink":"true"}}],"dc:creator":["Coupling"],"pubDate":["Thu, 08 Oct 2020 11:04:14 GMT"],"enclosure":[{"$":{"url":"https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/75a7cae7-70ee-4013-9c3b-27fae76c64b9_292x292.jpeg","length":"0","type":"image/jpeg"}}],"content:encoded":["<p>Hello!

I&#8217;ve been self-studying Cantonese and Mandarin for many years, learning mostly on my own. I also know a bit of Spanish. Coming up on five languages now, I recently discovered I loved learning languages.</p><p>But <strong>learning a language these days is often a lonely activity</strong>: tap on gamified apps, listen to headless voices, read textbooks, talk to strangers online. All these activities are helpful, but language itself is meant to be social. I have a native speaker beside me, all day every day. I wondered why the learning was taking place inside my own head when languages involve ears and mouths.&nbsp;</p><p>While backpacking in off-trail wilderness for 70 miles, through wildfire smoke, Heidi was teaching me more Chinese, and it was fun! I thought about the non-effectiveness of how couples normally try to learn each other&#8217;s languages, and I came up with ideas to solve this and help couples grow closer together. And here we are!</p><h3>How Coupling Will Work</h3><p>Coupling makes it easy for your native speaking partner to be a language guide without having to be a language teacher.</p><p>First, you self-study with <a href=\"https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition\">spaced repetition flashcards</a>. It&#8217;s a learning technique where you are shown flashcards right as you are about to forget them. The more you learn a word, the less often you need to review that flashcard. This system is used by polyglots and medical students to reliably memorize thousands of terms.&nbsp;</p><p>Then Coupling reinforces your self-study by lightly looping in your partner. You will be able to:</p><ul><li><p>Flag your partner for help in Coupling on flashcards that give you trouble. Your partner, whenever they are free or bored, can open Coupling and add a comment to the flashcard to clarify and explain. Or they can add some quick audio and video to the flashcard.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://learncoupling.com/challenge\">Play daily challenges and games</a> to practice listening and speaking. Real life usage reinforces your vocabulary you self-learned. This can take as little as five to ten minutes per day. Short daily sessions create a healthy habit. Even if you just learn one word per day, that&#8217;s big!</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Watch silly mini-videos from your partner that teach bite-sized pieces of the language. Because the content is created by your loved one, it&#8217;s personalized and makes things that much more memorable. Call it TikTok for language learning, but just between you two.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Generate flashcards you learned from daily challenges and via a messenger built into the app. The messenger will show a translation to your target language underneath each message, which you can tap to add to your flashcard deck and lock it into your memory.</p></li></ul><a class=\"image-link image2 image2-481-524\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffdc2a9aa-0457-4af1-ab1a-c81a5bb93a88_720x660.png\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffdc2a9aa-0457-4af1-ab1a-c81a5bb93a88_720x660.png\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fdc2a9aa-0457-4af1-ab1a-c81a5bb93a88_720x660.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:660,&quot;width&quot;:720,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:524,&quot;bytes&quot;:55764,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}\" alt=\"\"><style>\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-481-524 {\n            padding-bottom: 91.66666666666666%;\n            padding-bottom: min(91.66666666666666%, 480.3333333333333px);\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 0;\n          }\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-481-524 img {\n            max-width: 524px;\n            max-height: 480.3333333333333px;\n          }\n        </style></a><h3>The Right Balance</h3><p>By achieving the right balance between self-study and help from your partner, we avoid the <strong>two common pitfalls</strong> I&#8217;ve seen in couples:</p><ul><li><p>Over-reliance on the native speaking partner&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Under-utilization of the native speaking partner</p></li></ul><p>If you solely rely on your partner to teach you the target language, they will burn out. On the other hand, if you learn completely in stealth, it&#8217;ll be hard for you to remember anything without using it daily, and you&#8217;ll probably suck at speaking and listening.</p><p><strong>Coupling is a holistic approach: a spaced repetition flashcard system to help you learn on your own, while making it easy on your native speaking partner to assist you.</strong> Coupling guides them on how to guide you, lets them help you asynchronously, and keeps the minimal time commitment low.</p><p>There&#8217;s a big benefit of having a language guide that is very close to you. Your native speaking partner is aware of what words you know, what words you don&#8217;t know, your exact level of the language. When my wife gives me example sentences, she tailors the complexity and speed to the right level for me. And with my wife being pretty fluent (but not mastered) in English, I know I need to throw SAT-level words and up-to-date idioms at her.<strong> So your language learning is ultra-personalized</strong>, whether you are a beginner, intermediate, advanced, or near-fluent.&nbsp;</p><h3>Next Steps</h3><a class=\"image-link image2 image2-512-278\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2de79b0d-0552-48c1-919e-ed9a8fb1dd91_278x512.png\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2de79b0d-0552-48c1-919e-ed9a8fb1dd91_278x512.png\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2de79b0d-0552-48c1-919e-ed9a8fb1dd91_278x512.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:512,&quot;width&quot;:278,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:21575,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}\" alt=\"\"><style>\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-512-278 {\n            padding-bottom: 184.17266187050362%;\n            padding-bottom: min(184.17266187050362%, 512px);\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 0;\n          }\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-512-278 img {\n            max-width: 278px;\n            max-height: 512px;\n          }\n        </style></a><p>I have a lot of ideas on how language learning can be improved both for couples and in general.
