  Challenge
</h2>

One person, the hider, will hide an object (e.g., a favorite toy) around the
house. The hider must guide the seeker to the object using the target language.
The seeker must listen to the directions to find the object.

Then switch places!

The goal is to practice speaking as a hider, and practice listening as a seeker.

  Levels
</h2>

### Beginner

Listen or speak directions such as go, stop, forward, backwards, left, right.

### Intermediate

Listen or speak directions in full phrases such as "Go forward. Turn left. Go
forward. Turn right". Throw in other words such as above, below, under, on top.

### Advanced

Listen or speak the entire directions all at once. If you are the hider, you
must visualize the whole path and provide the instructions up front. If you are
the hider, then you must listen and memorize the instructions up front!

Depending on how advanced you are, get creative with the directions (e.g., "in
the room where I brush my teeth").

and listening!
